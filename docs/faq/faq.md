# FAQ

## Will there be an Ikov mobile client?
Not anytime soon I'm afraid, but it's not completely off the cards.

## My account was deleted from Ikov 1. Can I recover it?
Unfortunately not! We gave players a month before Ikov 2 launch to be able to save their original account username from deletion. All players started off fresh in terms of skills, items, donator rank etc. You can register a new acccount at [ikov.io/register](https://ikov.io/register)

## How do I unlock the benefits for being a Discord Booster?
You need to [login](https://ikov.io/login) to the website, visit your [profile page](https://ikov.io/profile) and login via Discord after boosting the Discord. If you have already done this previously, you'll need to login again.

## How do I update my Discord rank to match in-game?
The same instructions as the above question.

## How do I update my forum rank to match in-game?
Simply [logout](https://ikov.io/logout) the website and [login](https://ikov.io/login) again.
